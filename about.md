I am a Lead Machine Learning Engineer and Consultant specializing in Natural Language Processing. 

At [hypersonix.ai](http://hypersonix.ai), I am building a native speech and conversational interface to enterprise business intelligence and analytics. Along with a small team of engineers based in San Jose and India, we are bringing a Jarvis-like experience to the world of analytics.

Previously at [vernacular.ai](https://vernacular.ai), I was building enterprise language solutions to cater to a billion Indians who interact on digital platforms in Indian languages. I built in-house Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) engines in 10 Indian languages to replace Google's ASR for on-prem deployment. I also built the Natural Language Understanding and Dialogue Management components for handling conversations. Think Google Duplex, but in 10 Indian languages and in-house.

I am an avid reader, blogger, engineer and a trekker.

I am available on email at [contact@sujayskumar.com](mailto:contact@sujayskumar.com)
