I am a *Lead Machine Learning Engineer and Consultant* specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

At [hypersonix.ai](https://hypersonix.ai/), I am building a native conversational interface to enterprise business intelligence and analytics, with focus on Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Entity Extraction, Recommendations and Dialogue.

Previously at [vernacular.ai](https://vernacular.ai/), I built in-house streaming and long-duration Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) engines in 10 Indian languages to replace Google's ASR for on-prem deployment. I also built the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Dialogue Management components for handling conversations. Think Google Duplex, but in 10 Indian languages and in-house.
